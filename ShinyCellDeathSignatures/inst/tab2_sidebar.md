#### Predicted cell viaiblity

Using linear models we predicted cell viability for the whole LINCS-L1000 dataset. We used two models, one based on the matched L1000-CTRP data and the other based on the matched L1000-Achilles data. Based on our cross-validations the performance of Achilles model is better.
